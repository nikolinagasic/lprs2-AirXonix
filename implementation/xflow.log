  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
WARNING:Timing:3402 - The Clock Modifying COMP,
   vga_periph_mem_0/vga_periph_mem_0/USER_LOGIC_I/vga_top_i/vga_i/res_1.dcm25_i/
   dcm_sp_inst, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase
   relationship exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock
   Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained
   using FROM/TO constraints.

INFO:Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).
INFO:Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in
   the unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of
   this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.
